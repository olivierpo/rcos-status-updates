- Worked on project final presentation
- Found a great design for a search form, used that in the search page
- fixed a problem with the navbar where the link for login page wasn't working and the text was wrong

What I learned:
- Leading a group of people can be really complicated when splitting work.
- I need to distribute work in smaller portions so that they're more manaebale and so that it's less
devistating to lose a member mid-development
- I still do not like frontend development but the different frontend frameworks like vue and bootstrap make it more manageable
- We should get a better understanding of underlying technologies before trying to work with higher level ones
