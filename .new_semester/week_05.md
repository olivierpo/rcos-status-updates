- Really busy this week because of my genetics exam on Tuesday and all my labs due on Friday.
- Worked on my presentation (TensorFlow) which I'm doing on Thursday
- Made sure to get our architecture set up for everyone in the group to get used to. Will go over it in more detail
with them, in addition to making sure we have a final design for the website so we can work on components and containers.
