This week I decided to do ome factor analysis with my model. At the moment, I've just constructed a model with 2 word windows and a simple model that does bag of words. However, the factor analysis that i want to do is exactly with that window. To do this, I've looked at a few papers that I've marked below

http://aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2922 Although this one was biomedical, it was a good read for window sizes in word embeddings.
