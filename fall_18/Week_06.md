After a lot of debugging and a long conversation with Alex, I finally figured out why the linking in my ocker container wasn't working correctly. It wasn;t a docker issue but a Jupyter notebook issue. What happens is, if I don't restart the kernel between changes to linked files then those files never get recompiled. What threw me for a loop was the line that Jupyter was showing me where the error was coming from was the correctly edited line from the linked file, so it looked like I was getting errors on completely correct code, which is what caused the roadblock to last for so long.
