- this week i realized i had no idea what i was doing with the refactoring of our code. 
- I looked at Fabric and Sponge docs and have been researching what exqactly they do and what features they offer etc.
- The research has led me to the fabric-mc repo that should have a similar set up to chocolate (i think?)
