- I think i have it figured out! I'm almost done getting the deobfuscator to work. I really want to end the semester with at least something of value done!!
- Blockers are getting mappings to correctly work on the jar we downloaded with our download minecraft implementation.
- One thing im trying to figure out is why yarn has another project in fabric called stitch as a dependency in the configuration of enigma's ant java execution block. Stitch is used to stitch minecraft jars together but that should have already been done
