- worked on the presentation this week. Spoke with Scott about the features the project needs. 
- Started looking at Yarn again. The project is what fabric uses to deobfuscate the minecraft jar 
- Yarn uses enigma, a piece of software that decompiles the minecraft jar and then maps the decompiled code.
