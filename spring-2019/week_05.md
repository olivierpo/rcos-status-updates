- Gradle hello world tutorial from the Intellij website allowed me to set up my first project.
- was stuck on Gradle not working properly with the version of Intellij that i had installed.
- Problem was not that gradle wasn't working but some of the features of the version of intellij that i am using are differnt than the ones i was eeing int he tutorial.
